### Hello! I am Mingya,
I am a Ph.D. student in Quantitative Methods working with [Dr. David Kaplan](https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/fac-staff/kaplan-david/) in the Department of Educational Psychology and [Dr. Sameer Deshpande](https://skdeshpande91.github.io/) in the Department of Statistics at University of Wisconsin-Madison. Prior to that, I graduated with an M.S. in Quantitative Methods under the supervision of [Dr. Carolyn Anderson](https://stat.illinois.edu/directory/profile/cja) at Uinversity of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (2019). 
I am pursuing research in Bayesian statistics, machine learning, hierarchical clustering, and causal inference. Currently, my work focuses on Bayesian nonparametrics and its application in large scale clustered data.
