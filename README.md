### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Mingya,

I am a Phd student in Quantitative Methods in the Department of Educational Psychology at the University of Wisconsin - Madison advised by [Prof. David Kaplan](https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/fac-staff/kaplan-david/). I also have an MS in Staistics working with [Prof. Sameer Deshpande](https://skdeshpande91.github.io/). 

I am pursuing research in Bayesian statistics, machine learning, and causal inference. Currently, my work focuses on Bayesian nonparametrics and its application in large scale clustered data. 

Prior to joining UW-Madison, I graduated with a MS in Quantitative Methods under the supervision of [Prof. Carolyn Anderson](https://stat.illinois.edu/directory/profile/cja) at Uinversity of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (2019). My CV and contact details can be found on my [website](https://ajinkya-k.github.io/).
